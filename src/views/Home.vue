        <p>
          Polygon is on a mission to give every person with a learning difference the full range of 
          tools they need to thrive â€” from diagnosis to support. We believe that by helping people 
          discover their differences, they can harness their strengths.

            <p>
              An assessment with a Polygon psychologist is appropriate for anyone 
              age 8 or older.As soon as you suspect a learning or attention difference, 
              you should consider an assessment. Interventions are most successful when 
              learning differences are diagnosed early in life. Still, an evaluation at any 
              age can be an important step toward receiving proper support.
